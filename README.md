Readme – SecondAssesment-BACKEND-POSTMAN-NEWMAN

1- On Newman I created 2 Collections:
    • Positive testcases (Assigm_Collections.json) and 
    • Negative testcases (Assigm_CollectionsNegativeTest.json) this help me to identify both scenarios (at least for me is easy that way).

2- To run the scripts on Newman:

    • For positive Test on CLI: npm run testNewan
    • For positive Test on Report: npm run test-reports

    • For negative Test on CLI: npm run testNewman-negative
    • For negative Test on Report: npm run test-reports-negative

Note: for negative scenarios, I change some values of the positive scenarios to make them works.
